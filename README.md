## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Technical Solutions Specialist with a strong focus on cybersecurity, cloud technologies, and automation. I have experience leading global support teams, optimizing operations, and building impactful solutions, including an AI-driven chatbot that reduced ticket volume by 30%.

My core interests are in blue team operations, SIEM engineering, threat detection, and offensive security labs. I actively build and document hands-on cybersecurity projects, including Active Directory attack simulations, Elastic SIEM labs, and CTF walkthroughs.

Completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2025 with the highest honors (GPA 3.93).
CompTIA Security+ certified, with additional certifications from AWS, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Cisco.

I continuously invest in practical lab environments to strengthen real-world security skills.
